# SSH Brute Force Detection & Alerting

## Project Overview
This project focuses on detecting SSH brute-force authentication attacks by analyzing Linux authentication logs and creating alerts when suspicious login patterns are identified. The goal is to simulate real-world attacker behavior and demonstrate detection engineering skills commonly used in a Security Operations Center (SOC).

The project identifies repeated failed SSH login attempts within a short time window and triggers alerts to highlight potential credential access attacks.

---

## Objectives
- Detect SSH brute-force attacks using Linux authentication logs
- Build correlation-based detections instead of single-event alerts
- Trigger alerts based on configurable thresholds
- Reduce false positives through tuning
- Map detections to MITRE ATT&CK techniques

---

## Tools & Technologies
- **Linux (Ubuntu)**
- **OpenSSH**
- **Authentication logs** (`/var/log/auth.log`)
- **Splunk Enterprise** (SIEM)
- **Splunk Universal Forwarder**
- **Python**

---

## Architecture
- Ubuntu Linux system running an SSH service
- Authentication logs generated by failed SSH login attempts
- Logs forwarded to a centralized Splunk SIEM
- Detection queries analyze failed login patterns
- Alerts triggered when brute-force behavior is identified

---

## Data Source
Linux authentication logs: /var/log/auth.log

### SSH Failed Authentication Events

## Notes
This project was conducted in a **controlled lab environment** for educational purposes. All systems used private IP addressing and simulated activity only.
